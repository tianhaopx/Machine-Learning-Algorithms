'''Problem 1: Multi-armed bandit problem In this problem, you will implement an AI player for Multi-armed bandit 
problem epsilon-greedy method. The main goal of this problem is to get familiar with a simplified problem in 
reinforcement learning, and how to train the model parameters on the data from a game. You could test the correctness 
of your code by typing `nosetests test1.py` in the terminal. '''
